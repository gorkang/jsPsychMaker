A set of tools to help create experiments with [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/), randomize participants, etc.

For details about the available [tasks](https://github.com/gorkang/jsPsychMaker/tree/main/canonical_protocol/tasks), you can check the google document [Tareas jsPsychR](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Eo0F4GcmqWZ1cghTpQlA4aHsc8kTABss-HAeimE2IqA/edit#gid=0) (SPANISH!).

Each of the tasks should have a sister script in [jsPsychHelpeR](https://github.com/gorkang/jsPsychHelpeR) to automatize the data preparation. Using a simple function `run_initial_setup()` you can setup a full project to automatically create the full data preparation pipeline for a jsPsychMaker protocol.
