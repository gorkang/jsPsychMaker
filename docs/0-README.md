This folder contains the original scientific papers from which the tasks where implemented.

When there are validations papers in Spanish, we also include them.

When there is no validation paper and we implemented a translation, there will be a `NAMETASK_TP.csv`

The names of the files are [NAMETASK]_[ISO 639-1 standard language codes]. For example:

- CRT7_en-US.pdf for CRT7 in USA English

If a document is the questionnaire itself, include the suffix `_cuestionario`, for example: `DASS21_es-ES_cuestionario.pdf`
