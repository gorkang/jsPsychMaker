This folder contains the original scientific papers from which the tasks where implemented. The only goal to keep the papers here is to make possible for the users of jsPsychR to check the details of our implementation of the tasks and their correction. [Open science improves the quality, reproducibility and impact of science](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949).   

When there are validations papers in Spanish, we also include them.

When there is no validation paper and we implemented a translation, there will be a `NAMETASK_TP.csv`

The names of the files are [NAMETASK]_[ISO 639-1 standard language codes]. For example:

- CRT7_en-US.pdf for CRT7 in USA English

If a document is the questionnaire itself, include the suffix `_cuestionario`, for example: `DASS21_es-ES_cuestionario.pdf`
